# Graph-Data-structure-Introduction
Introduction
The Social Network App simulates a social network where people are represented as nodes, and their friendships are represented as edges in an undirected graph. The application allows users to create people, add friendships, and find the shortest chain of friends between two people using a graph traversal algorithm (BFS).

What It Can Do
1. Add Person: Add a new person to the social network.
2. Add Friendship: Create a friendship between two people
3. Display Network: Show the list of people and their friendships.
4. Find Shortest Path: Find the shortest chain of friends (i.e., the shortest path between two people in terms of friendship connections) using Breadth-First.

Why This Application Was Made
This application was created to demonstrate the use of the Graph Data Structure in a simple, real-world contextâ€”modeling a social network. By applying the BFS algorithm, it can efficiently find the shortest path (friendship chain) between two people, which is a common task in many real-world social network applications (like finding mutual friends).

How It Contributes
 The app provides a clear example of how graphs and BFS can be used in practical applications. It helps learners understand how data structures like graphs are used in systems like social media platforms.It can be extended to real-world applications, such as recommending friends in a social network or finding connections between people in a professional network.
